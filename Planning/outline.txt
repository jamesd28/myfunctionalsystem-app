Agenda:-

	public abstract class CalendarEvent(); 	//probably will need this
			//possibly an interface instead of inheritance
	-> instances = time, title, location, etc.
	
	Think of future addons, maybe we'll want a filter for events?
				maybe we'll want to add personal events?

Schedule:-
	
	public class ClassTime extends CalendarEvent(); // implements?
	add only ClassTime events to schedule
	
	list view and weekly view, maybe add monthly view in the future
		
Class Search:-

	everything will use our Course() class
	Course() can have an instance of ClassTime() ^^
	//Course extends CalendarEvent??
	
	make room for a filter!!
	
	have a way to view schedule, possibly a view of what the viewed 
	class will look like in your schedule before adding

MyPlanner:-
	
	Major + Minor requirements 
	links to "browse classes"  (Class Search)
	
	start with just a regular list of classes possibly with links to 
	download degree planner pdfs, if we have time, implement the 
	degree planner within the app or add later.


myCart:-
	
	Command Pattern
	undo an added course
	execute an enrollment

	Course objects displayed

Comments:


Course are viewed in the same way on multiple screens
(i.e. myCart, mySchedule List view, Class Search) maybe we could make an
object for it?
